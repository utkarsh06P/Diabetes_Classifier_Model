# Diabetes_Classifier_Model

-The objective of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. This is a     binary (2-class) classification project with supervised learning.

-Standard libraries of Pandas and Numpy are imported.
-Use Pandas to read the csv file “diabetes.csv”. There are 768 observations with 8 medical predictor features (input) and 1 target variable (output 0 for ”no diabetes” or 1 for ”yes”).
-The 8 medical predictor features are:
· Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
· Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
· BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
· SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
· Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
· BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)²)
· DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function on genetic influence and hereditary risk
· Age: Age (years)
